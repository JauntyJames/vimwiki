goto meeting was originally part of another company
sasha kumal, vp of engineering, very involved and hands-on


started with VCS video cluster services, piece that does video transcoding for goto
around 250 nodes per region, 8 ocpu nodes, phx iad frankfurt
went live ~ july 2021
had some issues where cluster autoscaler would kill good nodes

another issue: hit e4 capacity issues

A number of initiatives going on:
video gateways - head-end nodes talking to clients, dealing with video clients, require dynamic scaling, uses a lot of ingresses


Audio workload - stores video recordings on NFS share, when you call into an audio meeting it pulls from nfs
Sebastian asked about first byte read at node rotation

MCS - Screen-sharing worklods - some are not containerized, those have been rolled out on compute
legacy windows workloads - wanted to use BYOL


sebastian daehne - runs devops


need the equivilent of a readiness gate
issue where external dns is reading both the internal and external IPs when using an nlb with oke
