= Prometric = 

== People ==
Keith Greene - ECA contractor working for Prometric

== Highlights ==
* Some on-prem workloads remaining
* built on [[Azure]] by 3rd party
* Using lots of [[Azure]] proprietary services

== Architecture ==
* [[Kubernetes]]
* [[API Gateway]] in front of [[Load Balancer]]
  - Gateway is used to rewrite uri/path to different environments
  - They want a developer portal, not something [[OCI]] has today
* [[Ingress controller]] [[nginx]] - do they want this?
  - Ingress provides domain routing to various microservices
  - this could be accomplished at api gateway instead
* [[SSL]] terminates at [[Load Balancer]] 
* Palo Alto firewall in front of api gateway
* another one between gateway and lb

== Current Architecture ==

* using vmware (sddc) on prem
* Using App Gateway - azure service l7 load balancer

== Notes ==

- want a walkthrough of a sample of a hello-world from api gateway through to pods
- Use devops deployment pipeline?
- Use NSGs rather than seclists
- Oservability - what happens if pods start failing?
- What happens if a cluster if the version falls too far behind supported versions?
