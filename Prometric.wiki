= Prometric = 

== Highlights ==
* Some on-prem workloads remaining
* built on [[Azure]] by 3rd party
* Using lots of [[Azure]] proprietary services

== Architecture ==
* [[Kubernetes]]
* [[API Gateway]] in front of [[Load Balancer]]
  - Gateway is used to rewrite uri/path to different environments
  - They want a developer portal, not something [[oci]] has today
* [[Ingress controller]] [[nginx]] - do they want this?
  - Ingress provides domain routing to various microservices
  - this could be accomplished at api gateway instead
* [[SSL]] terminates at [[Load Balancer]]
