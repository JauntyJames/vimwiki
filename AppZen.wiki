== People ==

Chris Bollerud - Technical lead

== Technologies ==
    * [[Kubernetes]] ([[OKE]])
    * [[Container registry]]
    * [[AWS Step Functions]]
    * [[Elastic Search]]
    * [[Redis]]
    * [[MySQL]]
    * [[SQS]] OCI [[Queue Service]]

== Notes ==

- keep SQS messages small, if they're large they put it in s3 and pass a pointer in sqs
- FIFO - ordering not super important but nice to have, as is priority queue

- all ECS in expense, all K8s in others
- k8s version - 1.19
- 
- observability - fluentd is everywhere, elastic, prometheus, grafana
== Questions ==

* What limitations might they find?
  - PVC functionality?
  - k8s version?
  - LB functionality?
  - [[Container registry]] service limits?
